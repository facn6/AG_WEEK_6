The buttons and inputs do not work :/ but still you can view the web and the code :,)

#### Description

This website is an online forum that allows you to write a post about any subject (advertisement, job, idea, news, question and more) **the simplest way possible!**

---

#### How it works

You can -

1. Write a post that people can comment to
2. Comment on an existing post
3. Search for an existing post

---

#### Workflow

Firstly we had to start with the database design (tables) -

Each user can write as many posts/comments as possible and each comment is linked to one post/user while each post can have many commnets.

---

#### Next

We hosted the Database on Heroku using Node.js
then created a server with router and handler to connect the front-end and the back-end/Database!

---

#### If we had more time

- Work on some queries (that we could not finish within 2 days) to get information from the user and interact with the hosted Database add/get information for/from it.

- Work on the search-bar

- Work more on the front-end/css
